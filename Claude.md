## Startup Workflow (Each Session)

1. Check the project setup.
2. **Read `docs/01_plan/project-roadmap.md`** - To understand the project status and current focus.
3. **Reference context documents** - `requirements.md`, `implementation-guide.md` as needed.

### Task Management Process

Task Lifecycle:
  1. Identify task: From the current sprint or user request.
  2. Focus mode: Work on one task at a time, do not jump around.
  3. Implement feature: Code implementation with proper error handling.
  4. Test Suite Update: MANDATORY - Update the test suite for every new feature.
  5. Quality validation: All tests must PASS before marking a task as complete.
  6. Update progress: Update the sprint document only when ALL TESTS PASS.
  7. Commit clean: Use a clear commit message following conventions.
  8. Update status: Update the sprint document and `project_roadmap.md`.

Quality Gates:
  - Code compiles: The build must succeed.
  - Test Suite: All automated tests (connection + functional) must PASS.
  - No regressions: Existing functionality must not be broken.
  - No token leaks: Do not commit sensitive data.
  - Documentation: Update docs with test results.

Test Requirements:
  - Every new feature requires corresponding tests.
  - Tests must PASS before a sprint task can be completed.
  - The test suite must be maintained and updated consistently.

### Role of Document Groups

**`00_context/` - Technical Foundation (DO NOT EDIT WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL)**:
- `requirements.md`: Business requirements, project scope, success criteria.
- `implementation-guide.md`: Technical architecture, code patterns, API client structure.
- `confluence-tools-reference.md`: Complete tool-to-API endpoint mapping reference.

**`01_plan/` - Project Management**:
- `project-roadmap.md`: Project timeline, current status, sprint progress, next actions.

**`02_implement/` - Sprint Execution (UPDATED DAILY)**:
- `sprint-X-*.md`: Detailed task breakdown, acceptance criteria, daily progress tracking.

### Documentation Rules

Update Rules:
  project_roadmap.md: Update for major progress, phase completion, current status.
  sprint_*.md: Update for daily progress, task completion.
  00_context/: Never update without explicit approval (requirements, architecture, API specs).

Maintenance Principles:
  - AVOID DUPLICATION: Link instead of repeating information.
  - KEEP CONCISE: Overview docs stay short, details go in specific docs.
  - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: Each piece of information lives in one place.
  - CROSS-REFERENCE: Use links to connect related information.
  - STATUS FIRST: Always show the current status clearly.

Writing Style:
  - Concise and actionable.
  - Use status indicators: Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked.
  - Include time estimates and actual time spent.
  - Link related documents instead of duplicating content.

  Document Flow: `project_roadmap.md` → `sprint_*.md` → specific details.
  Never put detailed task lists in overview documents.
